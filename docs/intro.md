# Welcome to Playwright CLI: The Agentic Testing Handbook

> **The first comprehensive guide to `@playwright/cli`** — Microsoft's groundbreaking token-efficient CLI alternative to the Playwright MCP server.

## What Is This Book?

This interactive book teaches you to master **Playwright CLI**, a fundamentally new approach to browser automation purpose-built for the age of AI agents. Unlike traditional Playwright testing, Playwright CLI gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others) a token-efficient, shell-based interface to control browsers — achieving **4–10× fewer tokens** than the Playwright MCP server for the same tasks.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is written for three audiences simultaneously. Look for the persona callout boxes throughout each chapter:

| Audience | What You'll Get |
|---|---|
| **QA Engineers & SDETs** | Modernize your automation practice with AI-driven test generation and healing |
| **Full-Stack Developers** | Add autonomous browser testing to your TypeScript workflow |
| **AI/Agent Engineers** | Give your agents reliable, token-efficient browser control |

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter includes:
- **Concept explanations** with architecture diagrams
- **Interactive code examples** — run TypeScript directly in your browser
- **Interactive terminal sessions** — see real CLI commands and their outputs
- **Challenges** — modify examples and see what happens
- **Persona callouts** — perspective-specific advice for each audience

## What You'll Build

By Chapter 14, you'll have built a **fully autonomous QA system** that:
1. Discovers a target website's features automatically
2. Generates a complete test plan using the Playwright Planner Agent
3. Creates executable TypeScript tests using the Generator Agent
4. Runs the tests and auto-heals failures using the Healer Agent
5. Deploys as a CI/CD pipeline that runs on every commit

## Prerequisites

- Basic TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge
- Familiarity with `npm` and the command line
- Node.js 18+ installed

No prior Playwright experience required.
